# autogit

### usage

Literally just require this in a nodejs file in the directory.
Also yeah make sure you have inited a repo and also if there are merge conflicts it kills itself but other than that its okay...
Yeah make sure you always pull before a commit.

Right now it will pull on its own every 10 seconds just but idk
